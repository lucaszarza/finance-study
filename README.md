# Finance Study Repository

This is a personal repository dedicated to studying finance concepts and applying them in practice, with a focus on real-world cases.

## Purpose

- Explore and understand key finance theories and models.
- Apply financial concepts through practical examples and case studies.
- Document learnings and experiments for future reference.

## Contents

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and scripts covering a range of finance topics, including:

### 1. Markowitz Portfolio Optimization (`markowitz.ipynb`)
A hands-on exercise implementing Modern Portfolio Theory using real stock data. Topics include:
- Fetching and processing market data from Yahoo Finance
- Calculating portfolio risk and return
- Optimizing portfolios for minimum variance and maximum Sharpe ratio
- Visualizing the efficient frontier
- Bonus challenges: maximum weight constraints, Monte Carlo simulation, rolling window optimization

### 2. Monte Carlo Simulation Concepts (`monte-carlo.ipynb`)
Demonstrates Monte Carlo simulation applied to real-life scenarios, such as:
- Estimating the probability of completing tasks before a deadline
- Analyzing probabilities in games of chance (e.g., Russian Roulette)
- Probability estimation, simulation, and visualization techniques in Python

### 3. Portfolio Monte Carlo Simulation with Real Stocks (`stocks-monte-carlo.ipynb`)
Implements a Monte Carlo simulation for portfolio returns using real Brazilian stocks. Features:
- Fetching historical stock data
- Calculating returns and covariances
- Simulating portfolio value evolution over time
- Visualizing the distribution of simulated portfolio outcomes

## Usage

Browse the notebooks to follow along with the studies and experiments. Each file is self-contained and includes explanations and code for hands-on learning.
